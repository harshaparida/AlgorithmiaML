## Overview

Welcome to the **AlgorithmiaML** repository. This project aims to implement a comprehensive collection of algorithms, ranging from basic to advanced, in the realm of machine learning and data science. Each algorithm will be thoroughly documented and implemented using Jupyter Notebooks to provide clear, interactive, and executable examples.

## Usage

To explore and run the algorithm implementations, open the Jupyter Notebooks:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired algorithm's notebook and open it to view the code and execute the cells.

## Technologies

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Python**: Programming language used for algorithm implementation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
